            As per the latest statistics available by the National Institute of Health, over 8% of the general population has some kind of learning disability. Learning disabilities can range across a spectrum depending on the
            severity of the case but can be broadly defined as the difficulty in
            understanding and comprehending information as well as the inability to
            communicate it

          We can give children that extra time to develop their skills if we identify
          learning disabilities early. When we identify language learning disabilities in a
          young child, he or she has more time to learn to read and write with less
          difficulty.

          Our system is such an assistive tool for those that suffer from learning
          disabilities. We aim to make the process of learning easier by ensuring that
          we recognize the symptoms and consequences of the disability and use
          technology smartly to overcome them.

          This system uses the rules of human computer interaction to minimize the
          dependency on the memory of the user and focus on using intuitive tools and
          hints to make learning easier.

            While the instructors will have a simple interface for conducting quizzes
            and evaluating each student, the main challenge comes forth while
            interacting with those with learning disabilities.

            Unlike others, they do not find words or hints useful. Therefore, we plan
            to use various pedagogical aids specific to these students and design an
            interface which interacts with them through methods like audio/visual
            feedback, interactive quiz systems, flashcards, smart use of colours and
            other such aids that emphasize on sensory receptors.
